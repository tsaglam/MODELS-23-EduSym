# How Students Plagiarize Modeling Assignments

This is the supplementary material for the paper "[How Students Plagiarize Modeling Assignments](https://doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00032)" at the [Educators Symposium](https://conf.researchr.org/track/models-2023/models-2023-educators-symposium#event-overview) at the [2023 MODELS Conference](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2023). The supplementary material includes:

* results: contains the raw results of the experiment, including the experiment description and the answers of the participants (some may be in German)
* dataset: contains the plagiarized metamodels and their source metamodels (in addition to their Emfatic representation)
* task: Describes the metamodeling task used for the experiment.
* analysis: Offers additional material related to the manual classification and the analysis with [JPlag v4.1.0](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/releases/tag/v4.1.0).
* plotting: Contains the code used for plotting (R + ggplot2).

Please note that the student solutions from previous years used to evaluate the tool-based detection are not included due to publishing restrictions.
