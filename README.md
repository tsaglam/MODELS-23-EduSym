# How Students Plagiarize Modeling Assignments

This is the supplementary material for the paper "How Students Plagiarize Modeling Assignments" at the Educators Symposium at the 2023 MODELS Conference. The supplementary material includes:

* results: contains the raw results of the experiment, including the experiment description and the answers of the participants (some may be in German)
* dataset: contains the plagiarized metamodels and their source metamodels (in addition to their Emfatic representation)
* task: Describes the metamodeling task used for the experiment.
* analysis: Offers additional material related to the analysis of the results.
* plotting: Contains the code used for plotting (R + ggplot2).

Please note that the original metamodels from previous years used to evaluate the tool-based detection are not included due to publishing restrictions.
